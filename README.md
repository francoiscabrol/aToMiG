--------------

*A touchless and real time melody generation system*

**Written in Scala**

## The build system is sbt

- You need to install [scala SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org)

- The you have to add the LEAP_HOME variable that do the link with the leap motion sdk path in your bashrc (on UNIX systems). For example I added this following line:

		export LEAP_HOME="/Users/francois/Applications/LeapSDK"

- Then you can run it with this command line:

		sbt run
